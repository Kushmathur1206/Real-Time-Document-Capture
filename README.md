This project implements a document scanner using OpenCV, a versatile computer vision library. It includes functionalities to capture images either from a webcam feed or from a specified file. The captured image undergoes preprocessing steps such as resizing, grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection to enhance its quality and extract important features.

The key feature of this scanner is its ability to automatically detect the document within the image by identifying the largest contour. This ensures precise delineation of the document's boundaries, facilitating accurate capture.

Additionally, the scanner provides a user-friendly interface with trackbars for adjusting threshold values, enabling users to fine-tune the document detection process. The scanned document can be saved by pressing a designated key, enhancing convenience and usability.
